Explanation of what the project is / what it does-
Our project is a movie search engine that allows users to search movies. Upon searching users are given all movies with that title, a description of the movie as well as it's rating.

In addition to searching for movies via the search bar, users can browse movie and TV titles based on popular categories.

The project is based in HTML, CSS, and JS. It is styled with CSS Bootstrap. Additonally it uses The Movie Data Base with both Fetch and Axios. We deployed the project using Netlify.
